            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>READER, it frequently appears by the Hiſtories of all Nations, that Military Glory has not only ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up the Thoughts, but the Buſineſs of the most Illuſtrious part of Men, in court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which they have not only ſpared to expoſe themſelves to all the hazards and dangers imaginable, but preſſing on even beyond the ſenſe of danger, have perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to their immortal Fame, ſuch Heroick Enterpriſes and Actions as have ſhaken
<pb facs="tcp:51883:3"/>the belief of many into the higheſt degree of Incredulity, eſpecially ſuch as have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them upon bare report, naked and unadorned with the many Circumſtances that attended them; wherefore I have thought it highly convenient at this jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture to reſtore, if poſſible, their belief, by giving them a true Relation of the many famous Battels and Sea-Fights that have been fought under the leading of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, Kings, Princes, and Great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, the moſt expert of their times in Warlike Diſcipline, with their various Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and Fortune. Nor may it ſerve leſs to incite or inflame the Valiant where a Juſt cauſe offers an Invitation: Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of this Nature always being attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with powerful Motives to ſtir up even the Puſilanimous at leaſt to conceive a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous eſteem of great Atchievements, and kindle in Heroick Minds a reſtleſs Flame not to be extinguiſhed but by Death. <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtocles</hi> that Noble <hi>Graecian,</hi> whoſe Fame reaches to the end of Time, having ſeen the Triumph of <hi>Miltiades</hi> for a Victory he had obtained, could not (as the ſtory of him
<pb facs="tcp:51883:3"/>goes) ſleep, but became altogether reſtleſs till he found Opportunity to enter upon a command wherein he became the Bulwork and Glory of his Country; and it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of the Great <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> firſt Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> that whilſt he was but in a low Station, ſeeing the Statue of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, and being ſenſible what vaſt Kingdoms and Countries that Monarch had ſubdued and brought under his Subjection in a ſhort ſpaoe, he wept, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being equal to him in years, himſelf had not arrived at his Perfection, and thereupon ceaſed not till he made almoſt all the then known World at his Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; nor of this kind is he, who was truly ſtiled the delight of Mankind, and the Honour of our Engliſh Nation, the wiſe and valiant Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> to be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who reports of himſelf, That hearing the Ballad of the fight between the Earls <hi>Piercy</hi> and <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> ſung but by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Chanter, it raiſed in him ſuch a deſire of Martial Enterpriſes, that he from that time coveted nothing more than to ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize his Valour in the Field, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb facs="tcp:51883:4"/>became to his immortal Fame the wonder of the Chriſtian World. Nor does this Treatiſe conſiſt only of Battels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but of the Policies, Stratagems, and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of the moſt Expert and Renowned Generals and Captains, whereby they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured themſelves in a retreat, circumvent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Enemy, or obtained the Victory; To which a Scheme of Military Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is added, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with the moſt material matters and things appertaining to Engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, eſpecially as to what relates to Gunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Artificial Fire works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with ſomewhat that refers to Fortification; by which even the unlearned may have an inſight into that great and curious Art and Miſtery, and be made ſenſible at once of the danger and advantage that attend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus was the famous City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> retaken by the Chriſtians in thirty days, <hi>Anno</hi> 1099, after it had been in the hands of the Infidels for the ſpace of 409 years, and ſo great was the joy conceived by the Chriſtians who inhabited it, and had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſo many Cruelties under the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Governours, that with tears of Joy they embraced the Souldiers every where ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Praiſes for their Deliverance.

               <p>THE Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpleaſed with divers Princes of the Empire, and the miſ-underſtanding growing daily greater, they thought it the ſureſt way to arm on all parts, and ſtand upon their Guard, which making the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ſuppoſe it the beſt way to fight them ſeparate, he purſued <hi>John Fredrick</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> upon his return into his own Country, by ſuch ſpeedy marches that the Advaunt-guard of his Army attacked the <hi>Saxons</hi> before they expected they were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in thoſe parts, which created much Fear and Conſternation; yet maintaining only a kind of a flying fight till the groſs battalions came up, the Duke had leiſure to put his Troops in Order, and formed his Battel in this wiſe. <hi>viz.</hi> He
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51883:57"/>commanded the Foot-men of the Earl of <hi>Bichenlinghen,</hi> in whom he repoſed the greateſt truſt, and the Horſe-men of <hi>John Ponecan</hi> and <hi>Gaugulph</hi> of <hi>Eſlenhen,</hi> to take their Stations in the front, ordering them that if they charged they ſhould retire, and avoid, as much as in them lay, entering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a hot diſpute, till the ſignal was given to aſſure them the other Battels were in a readineſs; then he caſt 6000 foot-men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two Squadrons, and ſupported them with 500 Horſe-men, riding himſelf from Rank to Rank, to give neceſſary Orders and Directions for what was wanting, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing another 2000 Horſe as a Wing to cover the Foot on the Right ſide, and ſo cloſing his Battel to prevent the Enemies breaking in, he ſtood in array to expect the Event, whilſt the Emperour, with whom was the King of <hi>Romans,</hi> and the Great duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> placed in the Vaunt-guard of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my 600 <hi>Launces,</hi> with 600 <hi>Hungarian</hi> Horſe-men, 700 <hi>Italian</hi> Horſe-men, and 100 Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quibuſiers on Horſe-back, then he divided them into three Troops, the <hi>Hungarians</hi> he placed on the Right wing, the <hi>Germans</hi> on the left, and the <hi>Italians</hi> in the middle, and of the reſt of the Forces he made his battel, dividing it into three Squadrons, of whom he committed one to the charge of the

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:51883:98"/>obtained a fair Wind, by the favour of which in a few days he arrived at <hi>Almadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,</hi> a Town between <hi>Tangier</hi> and <hi>Arzil,</hi> and having viſited his Garriſon, and furniſhed it with all things neceſſary, he landed his Forces ſomewhat nearer to <hi>Alarach,</hi> to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them with Water, of which they were in great diſtreſs; and after divers Councils reſolved to march into the firm Land of <hi>Africa,</hi> whilſt <hi>Mulei Moluc</hi> was making great Preparations to oppoſe him, and withal ſent to offer the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> ten Miles of Country lying round his Fortreſs of <hi>Tangier,</hi> if he would withdraw his Army; but the King returned anſwer that he would not quit the Enterprize, unleſs he would put <hi>Tituan Alarache</hi> and <hi>Cape D' Aghero</hi> into his Poſſeſſion; but this ſeeming to the <hi>Moor</hi> too exceſſive a demand, he ſent back word that he muſt conſider of it although the ſiege was before <hi>Morocco,</hi> and ſo drawing forth his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, conſiſting of about 60000 men, moſt Horſe, he advanced towards the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who had entred by eaſie Marches the main Land as far as the River <hi>Mucazan</hi> without any other Interruption than a light skirmiſh, and were by this time increaſed by ſome Troops of <hi>Moors</hi> that came and ſubmitted to <hi>Mulei Mahomet,</hi> beſides a ſmall number of <hi>Andeluzians</hi> that guard the frontiers, ſo that
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:51883:98"/>the Army conſiſted (beſide thoſe that were left to guard the Fleet) of 13000 foot, and 1600 Horſe, not reckoning the <hi>Moors,</hi> who made not above ſix or ſeven hundred, <hi>viz.</hi> Ten thouſand <hi>Portugals,</hi> three thouſand <hi>Germans,</hi> a thouſand <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and ſix hundred <hi>Italians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Army of <hi>Moluc</hi> conſiſted of 3000 <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Andalouzia,</hi> as well Horſe as Foot, under the conduct of <hi>Doali Algori</hi> and <hi>Oſain,</hi> who had paſſed into <hi>Africa</hi> from the Wars of <hi>Alpuſſares,</hi> he had alſo 3000 foot, and 25000 Horſe, with 1000 Harquibuſiers on Horſeback, the moſt part of them <hi>Rhenega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos</hi> and <hi>Turks;</hi> and although theſe were the chief ſtrength on which he rely'd, yet over and above he had about 10000 Horſe, and 5000 foot raiſed in haſte, beſides a great number of <hi>Arabians.</hi> And in this caſe <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luc</hi> kept to himſelf the Title of <hi>Generaliſſimo,</hi> and gave the Title of General of the Horſe to his Brother <hi>Hamet,</hi> proteſting to ſtrangle him with his own hands if he was found guilty of Cowardiſe, he made likewiſe <hi>Oſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi> Collonel of the Harquibuſiers on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, <hi>Mahomet Faba</hi> of the <hi>Rhenegados,</hi> and <hi>Muſa</hi> Captain of his Guard.</p>
               <p>During the approach of the <hi>Moors,</hi> in this manner the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> divided his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in three ſquadrons, almoſt united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

In the ſquadron that ſeconded this were the <hi>Portugals,</hi> under the command of <hi>Michael d' Norogna</hi> and <hi>Vaſco d' Sylveria</hi> flanked with Harquibuſiers, and in the other which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the Rearward, were the <hi>Portugals</hi> under the command of <hi>Diego Lopez de Sequei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> and <hi>Francis de Tavora.</hi> For the Guard, of whom two wings of ſhot were formed, in the Rearward were likewiſe 300 Harqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſiers, and on both ſides of the Army the Horſe was placed in the form of Triangles. The Right Wing commanded by <hi>George d' Alancaſtro</hi> Duke of <hi>Avero;</hi> on the left was the Standard Royal <hi>Jean de Sylva</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Kings Ambaſſador, and <hi>Theodoſe</hi> Duke of

               <p>The Diſpoſition of the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Army fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than what has been mentioned, was as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> The Footmen who were all Harquibuſiers, were placed in the form of a Creſcent or half Moon, the firſt Rank being <hi>Andaluſians,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Rhenegadoes,</hi> and the third <hi>Africans,</hi> ſo diſtinguiſhed from others, for their living on the Borders upon the two Horns of the Creſcent, he placed two Squadrons, in each 10000 horſe, and behind towards the Rearward, at equal diſtance, followed the reſt of the horſe, in ſmall Troops, with a deſign to extend and encompaſs the <hi>Portugal</hi> Army; but whilſt this was doing, <hi>Moluc</hi> the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> King fell exceeding ſick of a diſeaſe that had long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Whilſt theſe things paſſed, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> approached, and in the Plains of <hi>Tamiſta</hi> both Armies confronted each other, when by the command of <hi>Moluc,</hi> whoſe ſickneſs extreamly increaſed, the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Horſemen extending the horns of their Creſcent, joyned them at the back of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army invironing the whole Camp in the form of an Oval circle, and then began to ſtraiten it, by drawing in their Ranks cloſer and firmer, whilſt their Footmen ſtood in the Front to oppoſe any further paſſage that way, when as the Canon from the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Army began to play, but without any great Damage; nor had the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> upon the diſcharge of their Canon much better ſucceſs, but the <hi>Portugals</hi> being ſomewhat diſmayed upon the ſecond fire, the King to prevent their further conſternation of that kind, gave the ſignal of Battel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the Squadrons of the Advantguard, and of the Horſe moved with wonderful force and valour, the Footmen encountering the <hi>Moors</hi> with great fury, ſo that a bloody and doubtful Fight began, yet coming to hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We again ſent out ſeveral Parties, but of few men on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to know exactly whether what was ſaid of the Enemy was true; but the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my on his ſide being not willing to lye ſtill, ſent 2 or 3000 Horſe that very Evening, which gave an Allarum to the Camp. As the whole Army ſtood at their Arms, it was impoſſible for them to do any thing, on the contrary they were driven back to the very thickets, and we durſt not puſh them further, as fearing there might be ſome conſiderable Succours behind the Buſhes.

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:51883:107"/>Places on the <hi>Drave,</hi> they agreed to purſue their march towards the former of thoſe Places. The Orders having accordingly been given, the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> put himſelf at the head of the Vanguard, which was compoſed of the right Wing, and that he might be under Covert from the Enemies that were in the Wood, he left ſome Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons and Battalions to cover the flank of the Horſe. The Enemies lying at watch to take their Advantages, made then a Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which perplex'd the Duke of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> He perceiv'd that they were going to fall upon the Duke of <hi>Bavaria;</hi> wherefore he De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach'd <hi>Picolomìni</hi> with his Brigade to go and give him Succours. And indeed they began to Skirmiſh with that Duke, who advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to encourage his Men by his preſence, a <hi>Turk</hi> ſlipt along under favour of the Buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and ſeeing the Elector have a Red-Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered Coat on, with a white feather in his Hat, and thence preſuming him to be a Perſon of Quality, he fancy'd it would be a brave Exploit in him to kill him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he fired his Fuſil at him, but inſtead of hitting him in the Body, he hit him in the left hand, and this made ſo much noiſe that all thoſe that were not far from his Perſon believed him to be dangerouſly wounded. Without farther Enquiry this
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:51883:107"/>ſame rumour was immediately ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Troops, and this might have been of ill Conſequence, had he not ſhewn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf immediately to them all.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, the Army being on its march, and the Vanguard having paſs'd a Bottom, it mov'd up along a furrow, at the upper End of which there was a Hedg that covered a Plain; beyond this Hedge were ſome <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Horſe, which were to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> while the main Body fell upon the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> making a ſhew as if they meant to come to Blows with him; but having avoided the Battel at the ſame time they ſeem'd to offer it, the whole ſtreſs fell upon the Duke of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia,</hi> who having orders not to Engage, contented himſelf with ſtanding upon the Defenſive part. This did ſtill the more Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden the Infidels, &amp; coming up very cloſe, and every other moment to try his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he ſent to acquaint the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> with the poſture of his Affairs, and to ask his leave to fight. The Duke of <hi>Lorrdin</hi> ſent him back word to follow the Orders they had agreed on in the Morning, but his Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral Highneſs ſeeing himſelf ſtill more and more preſs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:51883:108"/>but that when the Enemies were pouring upon them the caſe was very Different; that every other minute there fell upon him new Batallions and new Squadrons, which it was impoſſible for him to ſtand the Brunt of, by meerly keeping upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive part, that his Men being thereby Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, began to murmur at ſo much pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; that it was to be feared that after their having ſuffer'd much, they might take the Courſe of avoiding the Danger by flight, ſince poſſibly they would imagine they might honourably do ſo, ſince we led 'em not to fight.</p>
               <p>During theſe Occurrences the Number of the Infidels did viſibly multiply, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving flipt along a Wood, they wholly fac'd it, inſomuch that when the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> came to paſs, they made a Diſcharge upon them, which laid ſome of them upon the ſpot, and compell'd the Reſt to halt. To per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex them the more, they appeared at the ſame time at the Vauntguard, but then De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign being to make their utmoſt Onſets on the ſide of the Elector of <hi>Bavaria;</hi> they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded no further than to Skirmiſh which hindred the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> from being able to ſend other Succours than that before-mentioned to the Reer.

He made head againſt them with ſuch Troops in whom he moſt Confided, and having caus'd ſmall Field-Pieces to be plac'd at the head of the Batallions, they were put to ſo good a uſe that they kept the Enemies in great Reſpect. In the mean while, <hi>Picolomini;</hi> who, as has been ſaid, was ſent to the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s Succours, thinking him in great Danger, ran to him with his Men, and the Duke ſeeing him come, Commanded him to drive the <hi>Turks</hi> from a Bottom, which he had newly paſſed himſelf. <hi>Picolomini</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted this Order with great Courage, and being ſeconded by good fortune, he not only remained Maſter of the Bottom, but alſo purſued the Enemies to the very Wood, which they ſtill poſſeſs'd, and which was the place of their Retreat. There they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that they had unaccountably given way, ſince he had none to back him; Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that being aſhamed of what they had done, they returned to the Charge, and made ſuch havock of the Regiment of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merci,</hi>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:51883:109"/>which was of that Brigade, that in a trice they killed 200 of its men. The reſt ſeeing this, betook themſelves to flight, and the ſooner, for that they were all terrified to ſee theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who had cut off the heads of the greater part, which they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before them, howling at ſuch a rate, as was capable of daunting the moſt Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute. In this Occaſion was it that the Prince of <hi>Commerci</hi> was wounded with a Launce, and that the Count <hi>de Ligneville,</hi> the Major of his Regiment was killed, whoſe Head they cut off as well as the reſt. The reſt of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Cavalry, having this advantage on its ſide, fell anew with extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fury upon the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who was not a little put to it to ſtand the firſt Onſet; Nevertheleſs having with his own Perſon performed Wonders, and thereby given an Example to others, they all ſtood firm; Inſomuch that after a long and obſtinate fight the <hi>Turks</hi> begat to Buckle; but in ſuch good order, that in turning their backs they ſeem'd leſs to Fly then make a Retreat. This induced the Elector to conſider whether he ought to purſue them or not; but that held him not long in ſuſpence, they of themſelves return'd to the Charge, and that with ſo much Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and Fury, that had not the Elector

In the mean while, the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> having caus'd it to be view'd, and none of them being there found, we purſued them, but the Purſuit was not long. After we had march'd a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little time we perceived they had entred into Retrenchments, which we could ſcarce believe tho' we ſaw it with our Eyes. Theſe Retrenchments had indeed been made in haſte, and we ſaw they had not had time to compleat them; but as their ſcituation was advantageous (for they were between a Moraſs and a Wood) it was not judg'd convenient to advance further without firſt uſing mature conſideration. We perceived it to be the <hi>Grand Viſiers</hi> Camp, which was confirmed to us by ſome
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:51883:110"/>Priſoners, who inform'd us that there were ſtill ſeveral freſh forces that had not as yet ſtirred out of it.

This whetted the Greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Soldiery, who being vex'd that they had fought ſo long without having got any thing, ask'd why they ſtopp'd at ſuch ſmall Impediments. The Elector was altogether of the ſame Opinion, but the General Officers about him having given him to underſtand that the undertaking to force thoſe R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The greater part of the Retrenchment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only of Dirt and Mud, having been hereby levell'd in a trice, all of a ſudden we ſaw the Cavalry march, without ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Orders, telling each other that if they could but paſs, they were enriched for ever. That of the <hi>Turks</hi> ſeeing it coming with ſo much reſolution grew daunted, and without ſtaying for its coming up, fled cowardly away, abandoning the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry to the Diſcretion of the Conquerors. The <hi>Janizaries</hi> were ſtartled at the Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Horſe, nevertheleſs they marched up to the breach, which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with ſuch Courage as was near a-kin to deſpair. But the Cavalry having open'd it ſelf a paſſage thro' other Places, they were quickly ſurrounded and put to the Sword. The reſt of the Infantry ſuffered very much, and none eſcaped but the moſt ready at their heels. All the Tents were found in the Camp, which the Elector ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving entred made directly up to that of the <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> which was obſervable for its extraordinary Wealth, and for ſeveral marks which are peculiar to the Generals of thoſe <hi>Barbarians.</hi> He found no body in it, nor about it, tho' it was well worth the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:51883:111"/>pains of looking to, as well in regard of its ſelf, as of what it contain'd.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> advanced, and complemented his Electoral Highneſs upon the happy ſucceſs of that day, but having not leiſure to enlarge much upon that, he gave <hi>Dunewaldt</hi> orders to purſue the Runaways, and detach'd ten thouſand Horſe for that Expedition. This General found ſome of the Fugitives on the way, but making directly to the Bridge which the <hi>Turks</hi> had o're the <hi>Drave,</hi> he found the main body had paſs'd it, and had broke the Bridg after them. But the ſhore was all ſtrew'd with Cloaths, and Bodies lay floating o're the River. Two <hi>Baſſas,</hi> and ſeveral of the Principal Officers were taken Priſoners, with about 800 common Souldiers, and the dead ten times as many. The Conquerors got all the Canon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in 90 Pieces of Ordnance, and twelve Mortar-pieces, with Tents, Camels, Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, and Elephants in abundance, with all other ſorts of booty almoſt beyond Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:51883:113"/>pregnant Reaſons, for by it Men's fortunes are Raiſed, many times from the loweſt degree, to the very top of Greatneſs: and not only their Fortunes, but their Fame, which continues as a grateful Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance to their Country, and an honour to their Poſterity: nor can the profeſſion be ſaid to be beneath the Regard of thoſe of the Nobleſt rank, ſeeing the fortunes of Empires and Kingdoms are ſo often caſt in the Ballance, and require not only Valour, but Caution, Experience, and ſound Judgment, to reſcue them from many dangers. Nor muſt thoſe that would be truly accounted brave in this way, be unfurniſhed with good qualities and moral Virtues, as Prudence, Conduct, Valour, hardineſs, patience, but above all, ſeeing a Souldier carries his Life in his hand, he muſt be indued with Religious and Pious Principles, that his Conſcience being at peace, the terrors of Death, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of a fearful Judgment after it, may not terrifie or deter him from under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking any Enterprize that is brave and daring; for although a man given up to wickedneſs, may, when danger is afar off, ſeem bold and deſperate, yet when Death ſtares him in the face, the thoughts of his Immortal ſtate will trouble him, and the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:51883:113"/>twinges of Remorſe maketh his Courage flag; there are many things more, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be known, to which great Regard ought to be had, and eſpecially,</p>
               <p>When a young Gentleman, in what ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſoever, enters the Army, without prejudice to his Reputation, he ought to underſtand that he is obliged to ſhew great Reſpect to thoſe that are his Superiours in Place or Command, a civil Reſpect to his Equals, and to have a Love and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Regard to his inferiours, or ſuch as are under his Command, that in ſo doing he may win their affections, to ſtand by him in the greateſt Extremity; for, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where the Souldiers love their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, they will never leave him in any action, and gain to him a great deal of Reputation, when on the contrary they will many times ſhrink from him in the heat of the fight, ſacrificing their honour to their Revenge; wherefore although his Courage be never ſo great, he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to yield to Invincible neceſſity, yet it is more honourable to be taken Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, than to turn his back and fly, for if he be once ſuſpected of Cowardice, it will be very difficult to raiſe his ſinking Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and in many things it is better to confeſs Ignorance than be Preſumptious to
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:51883:114"/>undertake any thing he underſtands not, for thoſe to whom he makes ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious acknowledgment, will rather compaſſionate than deride him, and take pleaſure to inſtruct him, to ſhew their own Experience, and Reward his mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, nor is it any diſhonour to ask advice, upon Important occaſions, by way of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, nor need he therein diſcover his own weakneſs, but by a kind of a ſecret Inquiry, inform himſelf in what may prove advantageous: There are ſome General Rules that ought to be known by all, eſpecially by Commanders, <hi>viz.</hi> that a Captain of Horſe ought no more to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the command with a Captain of Foot in a Gariſon, than the other ought to do it with him in the Field, for in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it he would very much wrong his judgment, nor ought an elder Captain in a younger Regiment to expect he ſhould without peculiar Orders, or an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Commiſſion command a younger Captain in an elder Regiment, for their Rank is otherwiſe, according to the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the Regiment, and not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Date of the Commiſſion; nor is there a ſmall reſpect required from ſubal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternates, to their Superiours reſpectfully, in all places, thereby to gain love, credit,

                  <p>AS for the Perſon who will undertake to be an expert Gunner, it is highly requiſite that he be not unskilful in, or a ſtranger to the Mathematicks, whereby he will be incapacitated to work any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion by Rule, and conſequently be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to manage his undertaking by gueſs, rather than by any certain Rule; nor is the Art of Geometry to be neglected, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing height, breadth, and depth, as well
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:51883:115"/>as lengths are to be obſerved in this kind of menſuration, that ſo the plot of any piece of Ground or convenient diſtance may be taken to advantage. And as for the Neceſſaries wherewith he ought to be provided, I hope few or none that proceed to this undertaking are ignorant: yet I think it not amiſs to mention what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, that none may plead ignorance; and in this caſe they muſt have in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the following Materials, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Spare Wheels and Axeltrees, Rammers, Ladles or Scoups, Sheep-skins well wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Sponges to clear the Piece, Canvas or ſtrong Paper to make Cartrages when the Piece is hot and will not Indure looſe Powder without ſiring it as ſoon as it is caſt in, of which more hereafter: as for ſhot of all kinds, according to the undertaking, he ought to be ſtored, together with Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Fireworks and Torches, dark Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hand Spikes, Budgbarrels, Baskets, Match, and a well armed Line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock, with a pair of Compaſſes called Caliber Compaſſes, to take the exact Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miter of the ſhot, and the bore of his piece, ever obſerving to charge according to the thinneſt part of the Mettal, thereby to prevent breaking; and another thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary is to be obſerved, <hi>viz.</hi> When a piece
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:51883:116"/>to be fired lyes upon a direct line, or under Mettal, be ſure to ram it with a good wad, leſt the Powder lying hollow, and not full up to the Mettal, burſt it; and that he may move or traverſe his piece at pleaſure, he muſt have Crows of Iron, Coins of Wood, and take ſpecial care to know the depth of the Chamber or charging part; he muſt likewiſe be furniſhed with a ſcale whereby he may know the force, weight, meaſure, and carriage of his piece, as alſo the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion on the charge, and the weight of the ſhot.</p>
                  <p>As for the Names of the greát Pieces commonly in uſe, they are the Baſe, the Rabanet, the Faulconet, the Faulcon, the ordinary Minnion, the Minnion of the largeſt ſize, the Sacker the loweſt ſort, the ordinary Sacker, the Sacker of the oldeſt ſort, the loweſt Demiculverin, the eldeſt ſort of Demiculverin, the ordinary Demiculverin, the Culverins of the beſt ſize, ordinary Culverin, Culverin of the largeſt ſize, loweſt Demicannon, ordinary Demicannon, Demicannon of the great ſize, Cannon Royal, or of the largeſt ſize; and to theſe, according to their weight and bore, ought to be proportioned the charge of Powder and Shot; and by that Rule likewiſe one may know how far a Piece
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:51883:116"/>will carry; as ſuppoſe a Piece be eight foot long, weighing 1500 weight, and four in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Diamiter in the bore, charge it (for ſo much it requires) with 4 pounds of Powder, and it will carry a ſhot of 61. 160 paces, of five foot to the pace, provided it be not defective by Reaſon of Flaws or Hony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combs, and ſo proportionable the reſt of greater or leſſer weight.</p>
                  <p>As for a true piece, it is for the better diſtinction divided by Gunners into ſeveral parts, and thus diſtinguiſhed, <hi>viz.</hi> the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward moſt part of the breech is called the Caſcabel Deck, the Ring next to the Touch-hole the baſe Ring, and the ſpace between the Touch-hole and the next Ring is called the Chamber or charging Cilin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the ſecond Ring the Ramforce Ring, the third is called the Tronion or ballance Ring, that next the Muzzle is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Cornice Ring, the Extreamity is called the Muzzle, the top the Superficies, and the whole length the chace, by readily knowing which any aſſiſtant to a Gunner may underſtand what he is required to do.</p>
                  <p>As for Shot they are generally three ſorts, either Lead, Iron, or Stone, according as the ſtore can furniſh, or the Emergency requires; and in theſe, according to their weight, there is a diſproportion in bigneſs,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:51883:117"/>which to prevent trouble in a haſty En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, ought to be conſidered, leſt in weighing alike, they prove (eſpecially the latter) uſeleſs, by being too big for your Piece, and thus we conſider them.</p>
                  <p>The proportion between Lead and Iron is ſix to nine, ſo that a ſhot of Iron of ſix pound weight, is as big as a ſhot of Lead weighing nine pound, and the proportion between Iron and Stone is three to eight, by which means a ſhot of thirty pound of ſtone, is as big as a ſhot of eighty pound of Iron, and ſo proportionable.</p>
                  <p>If there be any cracks, flaws, or honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combs in a piece, which not only hinder its carriage, but many times indanger its breaking, you may diſcover the former, <hi>viz.</hi> ſtop the muzle and touch-hole of the Piece, ſo ſoon as ever you have ſhot it off, and if there be any ſuch thing, the ſmoke will come through inſenſible cranies, but if it be defective; by reaſon of the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> honey-combs, which are a ſpongineſs, or ſcaling of the metal within, you muſt ſearch it with a piece of candle, in a long cleft ſtick, or by reflecting the Sun-beams into it with a Looking-glaſs, which will occaſion ſo much light, that one may thereby diſcover them, though there is little remedy to be had in theſe caſes, for
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:51883:117"/>the bettering the Piece, nor are they leſs to be diſcerned, by ſtriking the Piece with an Iron hand-ſpike in all parts, for if it ſound hoarſe or jarring, then are there flaws and defects, but if it ſound clear, then account it a perfect Piece, and to it you may accordingly proportion your charge, for if the Piece be not ſound, or of no true bore, you muſt beware of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercharging, leaſt you endanger your ſelf, and others.</p>
                  <p>As for Cartrages, ſeeing they are very uſeful, in loading Pieces when hot, with often firing, and not able otherways to indure the powder, I ſhall ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of them, and their uſe.</p>
                  <p>Cartrages are uſually made of ſtiff-pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or canvaſs, upon a wooden Mould, proportionable to the Piece in the form of a Rocket-cartouſh, but larger, the firſt of theſe muſt be done by rowling the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per thick, and paſting it in each rowling, fixing to it a firm bottom, and the laſt by ſowing or glewing ſtrong canvaſs in the like nature; into the cavity put ſo much powder as is a ſufficient charge for the Piece, and ſtop it in lightly with paper, or flax, and ſo thruſt the hard end fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt into the chamber of the piece, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving about an inch vacant, that it may
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:51883:118"/>the better take air, and ſo with a ſharp priming Iron, pierce it through the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole and prime, then follow it with your ſhot, and diſcharge as you ſee occaſion, but by the way you muſt obſerve that your Caſes be dry, leaſt by damping the powder they prevent its firing, as alſo to make them according to the proportion of the piece, that ſo without any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, they may be ready at hand on all occaſions; as for the Ramers, Ladles and Sponges, all the difficulty in them, is to fit and proportion them to the reſpective pieces, having good ſtuff in order thereto.</p>
                  <p>As for the wheels and carriages of pieces, they ought to be much regarded, eſpecially in caſe of a march, leſt by their defect in breaking, they hinder any extraordinary Enterprize, and it as often happens for want of a true mounting wherefore take notice, that one and a half the length of the cilender of the bore, or chamber of the piece, ſhould be the length of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and the depth four d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:51883:118"/>
                  <p>As for the Turneons they muſt be ſo placed that the piece may ſtand true mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, leſt a falſe ſhot be often made, and in this caſe two thirds of the piece muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear above their Center, nor muſt Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage be wanting, eſpecially at Sea; and thoſe being ſtrong, ought to be four times the length of the piece, and the britchings twice the length of the piece, though great Pieces for fear of breaking looſe, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaying the Ship, are often coined and braced ſo ſtraight that they cannot give much way, eſpecially in caſe of a ſtorm. Now to charge and fire a piece dexterouſly, and like a Gunner, let thoſe that undertake it obſerve this Method.</p>
                  <p>Lay your budg-barrel or Cartrages of Powder to the Wind-ward, and your Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock with the fired Match to the Lee-ward, placing your ſelf on the right ſide of the Piece, and having cleanſed the Concave and the Touch-hole, fill your Ladle, but ſo as no Corns may ſcatter over, then charge it into the piece as home as you can, turning it by the end of the ſtaff with your Thumb and Fingers, being ſure to keep your Body clear of the Muzzle, and ſo drawing out your Ladle, ram a wad by three or four quick ſtroaks of your Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to prevent the Powder from ſcatte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:51883:119"/>in the Chamber; then put in the ſhot, and after it a wad in like manner, ſo that the Powder may be forced yet cloſer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it will deliver the ſhot with greater vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, and prevent any Vacancy that may occaſion the burſting of the piece; and whilſt this is doing, you muſt cover the Touch-hole to prevent any accidental fire from falling into it, then prime by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Train to the baſe Ring, and ſo give fire, ever obſerving not to touch the Touch-hole with your Match-coal, leſt it blow both that and your Linſtock out of your hand, and diſable it for ſome time of doing ſervice, eſpecially if the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole be any thing large.</p>
                  <p>If you are required to ſhoot at a random mark, or by Elevation, you ought to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that the Random of a piece is the intire diſtance from the place of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge to the place where the Bullet firſt falls or grazes on the level Line, or on the Ground, by Artiſts termed the Horizential Plain, and to obtain the true knowledge of this it muſt be practiſed in a level Ground where nothing may obſtruct the level Line, or leveling of the ſhot, and therein obſerve the diſtances of the paces from the Piece to the fall, then mount the Muzzle one degree, and take again the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:51883:119"/>like notice; and in ſtill mounting by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, you will be capable of perceiving how far the piece will carry mounting, or at the level with an equal proportion of Powder, even to the tenth degree, or ſo high as your piece is capable of mounting, which will in a good piece advance thirty or forty paces, of five feet to the pace, through which means an experienced Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by his Map may be certain at what diſtance to make his ſhot, whether into the Trenches or a Town, or to diſmount the Enemies Cannon, or to batter a Wall, Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark, or the Ranks of an Army; but if he would make a good ſhot at a party of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Horſe or Foot, or at a Ship under ſail.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve in the firſt place your length, to know certainly whether or not you are within reach, and if ſo it being in a ſtraight Line, in the ſecond place conſider the ſlowneſs or ſwiftneſs of the motion of the men or ſhip you intend to hit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon lying upon an equal level, neither too high nor too low, fire at another mark ſome diſtance before it, and beyond that, ſo by the two motions the Bullet and the Mark you deſign to hit may meet, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Bullet flys with incredible ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet it requires ſome ſmall time to accompliſh its end.</p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:51883:120"/>
                  <p>But if you aim at any Light either on the Sea or on the Shoar in a dark Night, then fix a piece of lighted Match, or a bit of a Torch on the Muzzle of the piece, and bringing that ánd the middle of the baſe Ring even with the light, if it ſtand ſtill, or be paſſing on in a direct line, and give fire, by which means if your piece be ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and carry true, you can hardly miſs your aim.</p>
                  <p>If a ſhot by reaſon of over-raſh charging (with one above proportionable ſize) ſtick in the piece, whereby if it be fired haſtily it indangers the breaking, diſſolve bay Salt in Vinegar, and pour it in at the Touch-hole till it has melted the Powder, then ſtrike the piece where the Bullet ſticks, the piece being lowred with the muzzle downwards, and it will fall out; if not, let the piece dry, and then put Powder in at the Touch-hole till you find a ſmall charge, and ſo give fire, having ſtruck the Bullet before with your Rammer to looſen it.</p>
                  <p>It is worth obſerving that if a piece by reaſon of its being often ſhot off be very hot, it loſes much of its force every time (after the ſecond or third time) leſſening ſomething of its motion as to the diſtance; wherefore if the occaſion will permit, it is beſt to let them cool between every ſhot,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:51883:120"/>but if not, cool them as well as you can with your Spong diped in Water, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>If at any time a Gunner for want of skill, or by miſtake has placed his piece amiſs, ſo that the ſhot flys wide of the mark, to mend it he muſt obſerve how much wide he was, if the ſhot has hit any part near the mark, and if it be too high, then muſt he bring the piece a degree low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or according to the diſtances he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives he erred in; but if on one ſide, then muſt the piece be breeched about, and if too low it muſt be better leaveled, ever obſerving that in making a true ſhot it is requiſite to bring the middle of the baſe Ring even with the middle of the muzzle Ring, both which being exactly meaſured, may be notified by ſticking up a nail by the help of a piece of Wax or Clay, and both thoſe brought even with the mark, only the top of the former to be ſeen, give fire, and your Expectation, if the piece be a clever ſhooter, will be anſwered.</p>
                  <p>Many it is true, leavel their Ordnance by Rule, and indeed it is the exacteſt way, though ſomewhat tedious, yet may it be done without any Rule by the help of a ſteady Eye, eſpecially if the piece be true, and a far ſhooter, only it requires the Gunner to be skilful in gueſſing at the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:51883:121"/>diſtance of the mark, whither it be in a right Line, mounting or declining, by bringing the mark even with the Muzzle and Baſe-ring exactly in the middle.</p>
                  <p>It is not the leaſt of the Gunners care to procure good powder, ſuch as may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily take fire, and retain its full ſtrength, for powder in long lying, taking unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable wet or the like, will loſe ſo much of its ſtrength, that a pound and a half will not work the effect of one pound, nay, that which is at the bottom of the Barrel is much more forcible than that which is at the top, and the reaſon is, becauſe the force of the Salt-peter, if it be not moved or ſtired about, tends downward, now to know good powder from bad, obſerve theſe Rules: Firſt, feel whether the Corns are well dryed, being of a dark blewiſh colour, and taſte much of the fire; ſecondly, take ſome of the Corns, and lay them upon a ſheet of white paper, and if when you fire them, they leave a black mark or yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſindge behind them, then is the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der groſs and earthy, and will neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure well, nor be of any great force, but if it leave no mark, or at leaſt a white one reſembling white ſmoke, then is the powder good, and will fire both quick and with great force.</p>

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:51883:122"/>buſineſs, you may do it either with Bags, Sacks or Barrels of Powder, though to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent dampneſs the latter is the beſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Powder in ſome Mines, where the ground is low, is obliged to lie upon floats, by reaſon of the Springs that are there met withal, then muſt the Powder be layed, ſo that by a Trane through canes or wooden troughs, the Bags or Casks may communicate with each other, and charged over with beams of wood, that it may riſe directly, and not ſwerve to either part, or burſting at the vent, it anſwer not your expectation, as for him that fires it, he may do it by a Match laid to the Train, and know by that how many hours it will be e'er it take fire, for ſix Inches of good Match will laſt an hour burning, or he may do it at a diſtance, through a cane train, or upon board.</p>
                  <p>If a Houſe be deſigned to be blown up, to prevent the progreſs of a fire, then the Barrel ought to be placed in the Vault or Cellar, under the main Beam, with a ſtrong piece of wood ſet up againſt that beam, from a croſs beam that covers the beam, that covers the barrel, to give the fire more force, which muſt if you would take it upright, be placed as near as you can in the middle or center of the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:51883:122"/>but if you would overthrow it, or turn it into a Street or Garden, then muſt it be placed near to that ſide you deſign to raiſe, and ſo by looſening the foundation, it will overturn it, as for the Train in this caſe, it may be layed upon boards, from the Powder covered, as it is laid with a woollen cloath, to prevent the ſparks of fire from falling into it before the time intended, by which much miſchief may happen both to the Engenier, and thoſe that are aſſiſtant to him, as ſome times too ſadly has happened.</p>
                  <p>In caſe a Ship that is ſunk in a River, or near the ſhoar, is not worth weighing, or cannot be well weigh'd, many hold it may be blown in pieces in the water, after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> Let down the quantity of two Barrels of Powder, or more in a Brandy-punchin, or ſome ſuch ſtench-Cask, doing it by the guidance of Ropes, ſinking it with a greater weight into her Hold, if poſſible, or if that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conveniently be done, it may be placed under her ſide, though the former is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and there being a long pipe of leather fixed into the bung of the Cask with roſin and pitch, that the water cannot penetrate, let the upper part of it be above water, ſupported by the floating of bladders, and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:51883:123"/>when all is fixed, have an Iron-bolt ready, that will eaſily ſlide down the pipe into the powder, which being red-hot will fire it, but as ſoon as ever you have delivered it, with a long pair of Pincers, it is the beſt way for you to make off with your Boat, leaſt it be overturned with wrecks that will ariſe from the ſhattered Ship, or you baſted with the ſudden ſmoke that will ariſe out of the water, forced and rent in a fearful manner with the fury of the fire, that ſtrugles to recover and joyn with its proper Element.</p>
                  <p>If you will weigh any Ship or Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, it muſt be done by laſhing together Lighters, empty Casks, or wooden Floats at low water, having ſlung what you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to weigh, load them likewiſe, that they may ſink the deeper, and the Cords or Chains may be drawn more ſtreight, by which means at high-water, being unload<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they will riſe and raiſe with them what they are faſtened to, if their proportion be equal, five Tun above the water, being computed to raiſe three times the weight in the water, by which method a greater, or leſſer weight may be raiſed.</p>
                  <p>It is requiſite that a Gunner ſhould know the weight of his piece, the better to enable him to underſtand what force

                  </head>
                  <p>AS for Fire-works of Warlike uſe, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the ſiege of any Town, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are commonly ſent out of Braſs Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars or great Ordnance, and ſome of thoſe for Recreation out of Mortars made of Wood or ſtrong Paſt-board, and ſometimes Canvas.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Mortars that are made of Braſs are to be of the fineſt Mettal, thereby to be free from cracks and flaws, and in them it is to be obſerved that if any of their bores be ten Inches in the Diamiter, the Mortar ought to be one foot nine Inches in length, &amp; the Chamber to be loaden with Powder three Inches and a half Diamiter, and five
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:51883:124"/>Inches deep, the thickeſt of the Metal above the fire Port, ought to be three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and a half, and ſo by degrees to leſſen or grow thinner to two Inches.</p>
                  <p>As for Mortars of Wood they are bored and turned much in the faſhion of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, greater or leſſer as occaſion requires it, but ought to be plated within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out with Tin or Copper, or they will be always in danger of burſting, and do but little Service.</p>
                  <p>Mortars of Paſt-board are made upon Rowlers glewed ſtill in the rowling, and corded over with Pitch and tarred Cords, and having cut off both ends ſo that they may be ſmooth and even, turn a foot and ſholder to faſten the Trunk upon, and in the middle thereof let your Chamber be made for the Powder ſtrongly plated within and without; and if the Mortar be ſix Inches diamiter, the Paſt-board muſt be an Inch and three quarters thick, and the Trunk about ſixteen Inches long, the Chamber two Inches Diamiter muſt be three Inches deep, and when the Trunk is upon the breech of Wood, it muſt be faſtned on with Coopers Nails, and corded over with pitch Cord, leaving ſo much ſpace as may ſerve to bore a Touch-hole, but theſe are ſeldom uſed

                  <p>A Granado in the firſt place is a hollow ſhell of Iron, Braſs, and ſometimes of Glaſs, in which there is left a hole to put in a fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet or Piſtol barrel to carry the fuſe, in the Compoſition is commonly Brimſtone, Salt-peter and dry Powder, the quantity of each being left in the mixture to the Diſcretion of the Engenier, as he intends either to fire or blow up any Houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſometimes they are filled only with whole Powder; as for the fuſe it is to be proportioned to the length the Granado is to fly, leſt ſooner expiring it fire the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado, and break it in the Air, and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made of Powder wet with Oyl of <hi>Petrolum,</hi> but ſometimes made of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>In charging your Mortar you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what quantity of Powder will carry the Granado, and ſo much being put into the Chamber, preſs it down with a wad of Flax, and after that place a Turf quite over it, filling the bottom of the Mortar, and ſo ſling in your Granado by the help of Cords,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:51883:125"/>obſerving the fuſe, which muſt be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into it within an Inch of the head, ſtand directly in the middle, when having prim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and touched the fuſe, give immediately fire to the Mortar, whoſe Touch-hole you muſt be ſure to keep always in good order, leſt the fuſe burn out before the Powder in the Chamber take fire, and ſo indanger not only the breaking of the Mortar, but the deſtroying of your ſelf and others.</p>
                  <p>There are an other ſort of Granados, though to the ſame effect, made of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas and ſtrong Paſt-board, wetted with Oyl of Spike, or it may be done with Brandy or Water, mold them upon a round ball of Wood with Glew and Pitch in each doubling, and when they are well dryed, cut them in half to take out the Ball, then put them together with Glew, and cover them over with other ſtrong Canvas coated with Pitch, and ſo bind them ſtrongly together with Cords, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a hole to charge at, and for the fuſe, and theſe many times do the ſame Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as Shells, and ought to be managed the ſame way? but are ſometimes filled with Wild-fire, Pitch, Roſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being then rather deſigned to fire than blow up.</p>
                  <p>Hand Granados are in effect the ſame with the former, though much leſs, their
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:51883:126"/>Shells are made of concave Iron, with a fuſe of Paper, Reed or Quills, and ſometime are made of Glaſs, Earth, or Wood, but thoſe for Sea are more commonly of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas or Paſt-board, which are kept hollow by rowling upon a bottom of Twine, and paſted or glewed ſtill in the rowling till they become an Inch thick in the caſe, when being dryed, one end of the thread left at a hole for that purpoſe is drawn out many there are that ſtick pieces of Lead, or half Muſquet-bullets about them, that when they burſt, thoſe many forcibly ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and wound the Enemy. As for their Compoſition it is generally Powder, Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone and Salt-peter, but may be filled with dry Powder if occaſion require it; the fuſe being at the ſame time made of Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, and grafted in with Pitch or ſoft Wax, leaving the head of it about a quarter of an Inch above the Shell.</p>
                  <p>There has been formerly uſed in firing Towns and Caſtles a ſtrange way, which is now altogether left off, yet it may not be amiſs to recite it, <hi>viz.</hi> Inſtead of a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar the Engeniers were wont to dig a deep cavety in the Ground ſlant ways, with the mouth of it towards the Town in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a mouted Cannon, bricking or ſtone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it round in the form of a Well, in the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:51883:126"/>bottom of which they placed a Barrel, or as much as was convenient of Powder, laying Beams a croſs over it, and upon thoſe Beams a quantity of Turf and Earth, then having a huge Faggot of Timber prepared, bound ſtrongly with Iron-chains, it was put into this place all on a fire, and ſo by the means of a Train, the Powder firing, blew it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place deſigned with great force, the ground ſerving in thoſe days inſtead of a Mortar, but probably without any certain Aim.</p>
                  <p>The Sea-men, for firing Ships, were wont to make flaming Arrows in this ſort, <hi>viz.</hi> taking the head and ſhaft of a broad Arrow, and the Iron of the head being very long, they made an Oval-caſe of ſtrong Canvas and Paſt-board, glewing it firmly in all parts, and this being filled with a compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Salt peter, Gun powder, Brimſtone, made into Wildfire with the Oyl of <hi>Petrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi> is fixed upon the neck of the head, the caſe being punched full of holes, and when fired, and flung with a ſtrong hand, it will ſtick in the ſide maſt of a Ship, and if not ſuddenly prevented, will ſet it on fire.</p>
                  <p>Stink-pots are made of Earth, and filled with Tar, Turpentine, and beaten Brimſtone, in which is a great wad of Hemp, and ends of Rope, which being fired and thrown on
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:51883:127"/>board, breaks upon the Deck with a ſtream of flame, ſending withal ſuch a ſtench and noiſome ſmoke, that it not only indangers the Ship, which it many times fires, but forces the Men from their ſtations, and gives the throwers an opportunity to enter.</p>
                  <p>Carcaſſes, now much in uſe, are made up with Leather and Canvas, ſtrongly bound, glewed and pitched, filled with a compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Powder, Brimſtone, Salt-peter, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin, Pitch, Turpentine, and the like, and thrown out of Mortars and Engins.</p>

                  <head>The Art of making and preparing Artificial Fire-works for Recreation, after the neweſt and beſt Invention, in ſundry forms and manners, pleaſant and profitable, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>AS for Artificial Fire works, there are ſundry ſorts relating to Recreation, but in general, I may reduce them under three heads, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe that aſcend in the Air, thoſe that expire on the Earth, and ſuch as ſwim in the water, and theſe again I may as properly divide into three particular ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe for the Air are the Balloon, the Sky-rocket and the flying Sauciſſion, for the Earth the fiery Lances, the ground Rocket,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:51883:127"/>and the ground Sauciſſions; for the Water, double and ſingle Rockets, Globes or Balls, but before I proceed to the compoſition, I ſhall ſay ſomething of the Moulds, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>If the caliber or bore of your Mould be an Inch in Diameter, then ought it to be ſix Inches in length, being made for a Rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et of the Air, and the breech one Inch and a half, the Broach being no leſs than 3 Inches long, and in thickneſs a quarter of an Inch circumference, the Rowler in this caſe muſt be three quarters of an Inch Diameter, and the Rammer half an Inch, being hollow at one end to receive the Broach, for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſh coffin muſt be loaded, the Broach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in; if the bore be two Inches Diameter, the Rocket muſt be a Foot long, if but half an Inch, it muſt be in length but three Inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and ſo proportionable, as it is more or leſs in the Diameter, as alſo the Breech muſt be coherent, or elſe they will never mount well.</p>
                  <p>In the compoſition of a Sky-Rocket, the principal thing to be conſidered, is an exact and proportionable mixture, therefore for the compoſition of middle ſized Rockets, add no more than two ounces of Charcole to a pound of Powder, both being bruiſed and ſearced through a fine Sieve of Lawn, or ſuch a like material, with which fill your
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:51883:128"/>Rocket, the Head and Broach being in, putting in the Powder by degrees, and preſſing it down between each, filling with your Rammer, then try it, and if it break or burn out too faſt, add more Charcole duſt, but if it burn dull and refuſe to mount, then add more Powder, and ſo order it, till you find it anſwer your expectation, and for defect of Charcole, you may uſe Seacole, finely beaten, but it will not make ſo bright a Tail, for as the Powder forces the Rocket to mount, ſo the Charcole makes the fiery train. If you would have it ſparkle much in mounting, you may put ſome Salt-peter meal into it, if you would have your Rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et give a Report after the Fuſe is ſpent, you muſt put a piece of Paper, when it is three parts charged, with the compoſition, and making a hole in the middle of it, put after it a Piſtol charge, or ſo much as will fill it, of corned Powder unbruiſed, and ſo dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in the breech, ſeal it down with wax, pitch, or glow, obſerving always the Caſes be well choaked in the Primer, or you may, for want of wax, or the like, choak the But end with a Cord, and ſo cut it off.</p>
                  <p>To fire your Rocket for the Air, faſten to it a ſtraight wand, ſufficient to poiſe it, and fix it with the mouth, and the Tail
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:51883:128"/>of the wand downward, upon ſome place above your height, and ſo with a Fuſe or Match give fire, or by a Train you may fire ſix or ſeven together, making them ſpread in the Air, like fountains of fire.</p>
                  <p>Ground Rockets, as to their Moulds, are made in the manner of the former, but the compoſition ſomewhat differs, for in this caſe Powder duſt and Salt-Peter-meal very fine ſifted are required, which muſt be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly rammed by degrees, till within an Inch of the Top, and then a Piſtol charge of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Powder being put in Choke up the end exceeding cloſe with a ſmall cord, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off what hangs over, leave it picked.</p>
                  <p>In this manner Serpents, commonly uſed to adorn great Fire-works, are made, but if you intend them to mount, let your filling be only beaten Powder well fiſted, and if you deſign them with a Train, then it will require ſome Charcole duſt, at leaſt an ounce to ſix ounces of Powder.</p>
                  <p>To make the Reſemblance of Golden Rain, and Stars of divers ſorts, having filled a great Rocket for the Air, with a charge of hard Powder, make upon the breech of him a kind of a Gallery, by drawing over a greater caſe, or paſting on ſtiff paper, then having filled about thirty or forty Gooſe
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:51883:129"/>quills, or ſo many as it will hold, with bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Powder, Brimſtone, and Salt-peter, bore the end of the Rocket full of holes, and paſte them into that vacancy, that they may not fall off till the Rocket is ſpent, and then by ſome Powder ſcattered under them, they taking fire will appear to thoſe that are on one ſide of the, like the ſtreamers of a Comet or golden rain, and to ſuch as are under them like a ſhow of fire.</p>
                  <p>As for Stars, they are eſpecially two ſorts, made of dry and wet Powder; to make the firſt of theſe, take a pound of Salt-peter, half a pound of Brimſtone, a quarter of a pound of bruiſed Gun-powder, beaten finely, and well ſifted, ſow up as much of this compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in a double Rag, pierced full of holes, as the quantity of a Walnut, and wet the Rag over on the ourſide with the Oyl of <hi>Petrolum,</hi> fix of theſe ſix or eight upon the head of a great Rocket, ſo that when it is at its higheſt, they may take fire, at what time they will expand themſelves in flame, and appear for a time to the Spectators like real Stars.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ſort of Stars are compounded of Salt-peter, half a pound of Brimſtone and half a pound of Powder groſly bruiſed, and wet with the Oyl of <hi>Petrolum,</hi> and made up into Pellets as big as Wall-nuts, dry
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:51883:129"/>them by rowling in the duſt of dry Powder, and fix five, ſix, or ſeven of them upon a great Rocket, and ſend it up into the Air, by which means when it is ſpent, theſe Stars will fire, yet will not blaze bright as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but fall more like a body of Fire, by reaſon of the Compoſition of moiſture.</p>
                  <p>Stars there are of an other ſort, which give reports at the going off like Piſtols, and theſe are compoſed of Salt-peter, Brimſtone and Powder made into Wildfire with <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> and Oyl of <hi>Tartar,</hi> faſtned to the heads of ſhort Caſes filled with dry Powder, and of theſe a large Rocket will carry up eight or nine, and give fire to them upon its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring; but they ought for the better ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them till they fire, to be put into a great caſe, one part of which may ſhut over the ſtern of the Rocket.</p>
                  <p>To make Fire-boxes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ire-launces, and Fountains of Fire, obſerve the following di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
                  <p>The Fire-box conſiſts of a great many ſmall Rockets put into a great Cartouſh, which fired by Trains, fly out one by one, and ſometimes altogether, with prodigious noiſe and fury.</p>
                  <p>The Fire-launce in all reſpects is to be moulded as the ground Rocket, only the Cartouſh muſt be Paſt-board glewed as it is
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:51883:130"/>rolled, and bound about with ſmall Cords, nor muſt there be any broach in it whilſt it is a filling. The Compoſition if you deſire it to have a long firy train upon the Water, muſt be one pound of Salt-peter, half a pound of Brimſtone-duſt, and half a pound of Powder all finely beaten together, with two ounces of Charcole duſt, but if you would have it burn bright like a Candle, then to one pound of Salt-peter, and half a pound of Brimſtone, put a quarter of a pound of Powder, and faſten to each of them a Rod in the nature of a Sky-Rocket, and they will when fired live along while upon the Water, and appear in a dark Night ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding pleaſant.</p>
                  <p>To make Trees or Fountains of Fire, fix divers ſmall Rockets on the head of a great one, by running their Rods through a broad overbearing of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>aſt-board, and if they fire whilſt the Rocket is aſcending, they will ſpring up and ſpread in ſtreams of Fire, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the branches of a Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>, but if they fire when the Rocket is juſt ſpent and deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they will appear like the Streams of a Fountain in Fire.</p>
                  <p>A Fire-wheel or Gerondel is very pleaſant, eſpecially to adorn the Angles of great Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, and is ordered after this manner: Prepare a wodden Wheel in the faſhion of
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:51883:130"/>a ſpinning Wheel, but the rim ſome what narrower, and faſten round it Rockets of the ſmalleſt ſize, ſo that the tail of the one may by a train wraped up in Paper, fire the head of the other, when as the Wheel being put upon a pin of wood, the Rockets will fire one by one, and the force of them will carry it round with incredible ſwiftneſs till all be ſpent; obſerve to put them upon the Wheel in the nature of a Wheel-band, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Balloun is accounted the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of all Fire works, tending to Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and muſt be ſhot out of a Paſt-board Gun or Mortar, to make which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given directions.</p>
                  <p>As for the making the Balloun, you muſt prepare ſtrong Paper or Paſt board, and rowl it upon a wooden Rowler eight Inches in Circumference, or ſomewhat more, glewing it between every rowling, then choak the Cartouſh at one of the ends, leaving a little hole for a port-fire, which muſt be of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance by way of fuſe till the Balloun can come to its height, which done, put in as many Serpents as the Cartouſh will hold, and amongſt them three or four Sauciſſions to break it, making them not to differ in length from the Serpents, fill them with the Compoſition of the Air Rockets, preſſing the touch, if dry, ſtrongly into the throats of each
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:51883:131"/>of them, unleſs you make your fuſe of Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, and then it needs not, obſerving ever to let the necks of the Sauciſſions to be longer than thoſe of the Serpents, that ſo they may all take fire before the Balloun is broken, and upon the Crown of each place a conſiderable number of either ſort of Stars, and ſmall quills of Brimſtone-powder and Salt-peter, then choak the other end as ſtrongly as may be, and prime it with ſtouple or Cotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>week dipped in wet Powder, and afterward very well dryed again, and ſo having charged your Mortar or Paſt-board Gun, with the muzel mounted upwards, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>end it into the Air, and when it is at its height it will break, and preſent divers delightful Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, repreſenting ſundry ſhapes and forms.</p>
                  <p>Flying Sauciſſions are made as to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſh, in the manner of a ground Rocket, but the filling muſt be whole Powder, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſo much duſt-Powder and Charcole as will ſerve for a port-fire till they can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered at their height in the Air, which muſt be done out of Paſt-board Guns ſet in a Row upon a bench or piece of Wood, and fired by a train underneath, and they will give reports in the Air like Muskets.</p>
                  <p>The Guns muſt be made upon Rowlers of Wood, with ſtrong Paſt-board about a foot and a half, or two foot in length,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:51883:131"/>worked in the rowling with Glew, or well made Paſt-board, and being corded over, they muſt be choaked with a ſtrong Cord at one end, only leaving a ſmall hole at the bottom to give fire; as for the bore of each it muſt be proportioned to the Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſions.</p>
                  <p>If you would have Rockets run upon a Line backward and forward, you muſt chooſe a ſmooth and even line, and ſtripe. it over with Soap to make it run more glib, faſten two Rockets of the Compoſition of the Sky Rockets, head and tail, one on the one ſide, and the other on the other ſide of a ſmall Cane, through which the Line muſt paſs; ſo that when one is ſpent by running one way on the Line, the other may fire and come back again; and upon theſe you may place the forms of Dragons, Ships, or Men, which in the Night-time will appear dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Beholders.</p>
                  <p>In caſe you are diſtreſſed for Match to uſe on theſe or the like Occaſions, take hempen Cords that have not been pitched or dawbed with Tar, pull them to pieces, and then twiſt the looſe ſtuff to the bigneſs of a mans Thumb, and boyl it in Wood-ly-aſhes, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a ſmall quantity of Salt-peter until the Lye be conſumed, then make it up, and draw it through your hand, holding part of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:51883:132"/>the pieces or remainder therein twice or thrice, and dry it in the Sun.</p>
                  <p>Stopple or priming week is no other than Cotton-wool boiled in Water and Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, and afterward dryed in the Sun, or by the Fire: And thus Reader I hope I have performed this undertaking to your Satisfaction.</p>
